# Amaru maintainers committee composition

## Context

Amaru is meant to be(come) a rather large and complex project, spanning over multiple years. 

The ambition of the project is to build a new fully interoperable block-producing node for improving the overall performance the Cardano blockchain. 

The Amaru node wants to provide a simplified entry point for building things on Cardano by using a modular design and Rust as its main coding language.

## Motivation

In order to manage the decision making on the project and have a compelling product oversight, Matthias and Santiago want to extend their maintainers committee's responsibilities to other members.

## Decision

Here is the new composition of the Amaru maintainers committee:

| Matthias Benkort <br/> [@KtorZ][] | Santiago Carmuega <br/> [@scarmuega][] |Andrew Westberg <br/> [@AndrewWestberg][] |  Arnaud Bailly <br/> [@abailly][] | Chris Gianelloni <br/> [@wolf31o2][] |   Pi Lanningham <br/> [@Quantumplation][] | Sebastien Guillemot <br/> [@wolf31o2][] |
| ---                               | ---                                           | ---                            | ---                            | ---                             | ---                            | ---                             |

## Discussion points

- We need to have a diverse enough point of view in the maintainers committee to enlighten the decision making process
- Each scope owner on the project still has the decision making power for everything that relates specifically to his scope
- The maintainer committee reach a decision by having a minimum of four votes in favour of a decisions for it to be accepted
